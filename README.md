<p align="center"> Hello!!! You will mostly see me underneath the spawn, the bsd and prjsk area, and sitting with friends ^^
&nbsp;
<p align="center"> My skins are mostly from Project Moon (mainly Limbus Company) but I usually dress up as my fav characters in the areas you'll see me stay in.
&nbsp;
<p align="center"> I sometimes don't have "c + h" in my skin name but pls don't be afraid to sit with me! I love to sit and chill with the fandoms I'm in ♡
&nbsp;
<p align="center"> Lastly, I mostly don't talk and usually I just want to sit near or with the fandom I'm in so I apologize in advance if I don't talk 
&nbsp;
<p align="center"> 《Fandoms I'm in: Bungou Stray Dogs, Project Moon (Limbus Company), Project Sekai, Uma Musume》
